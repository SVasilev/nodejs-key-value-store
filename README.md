NOTE: Command line interface is case-insensitive and it removes all unnecessary whitespaces.

How the command line interface should be used:
You can type --help or -h to see all the available commands.
The command arguments marked with <> are mandatory, while the command arguments marked with [] are optional.
You can also see detailed manual for a specific command by typing: '<command> help', where <command> is one of the available commands.
