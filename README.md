# text
NOTE: Command line interface is case-insensitive and it removes all unnecessary whitespaces.

How the command line interface should be used:
You can type --help or -h to see all the available commands.
The command arguments marked with <> are mandatory, while the command arguments marked with [] are optional.
You can also see detailed manual for a specific command by typing: '<command> help', where <command> is one of the available commands.

# TODO

  CliPromtBuilder, because it is unfinished
  Commands (not sure if needed)

  KVStore, because it is unfinished
  Space

Add KVStore.js methods implementation.
Add implementation for all the methods listed in availableCommands.js in Commands.js. The implementation of the methods should use KVStore.js methods implementation.
